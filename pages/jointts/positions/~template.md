## Opportunity overview

These opportunities are located in the General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Technology Transformation Services (TTS). TTS applies modern methodologies and technologies to improve the lives of the public and public servants. We help agencies make their services more accessible, efficient, and effective with modern applications, platforms, processes, personnel, and software solutions.

We will be interviewing and hiring for this role on an ongoing basis and to help navigate the process, we’ve created a [guide](https://join.tts.gsa.gov/rolling-hiring/) to help explain what to expect after submitting your resume.

## Role summary

Designers at TTS work across design contexts. They drive research activities, derive insights, generate concepts, communicate those concepts clearly, and work with cross functional teams to build and test them. They model best practices in user-centered design within TTS and across the federal government through advocacy and coaching.

Our Designers have deep experience in user research (generative, foundational and evaluative). In addition to research, we look for strong craft skills, confidence, and sophistication in at least one of the following areas: interaction design, product design, service design, content design and/or information architecture.

As a Designer, you’ll work in cross-functional teams made up of experts in design, product strategy, technical architecture, software engineering, data science, and procurement. In addition to building useful and usable digital services, you will be helping teams improve their user-centered design practice, and helping teams without those practices get started.

If you are committed to improving government services for all who need them this is the position for you.

Types of designers we are currently hiring for:
- UX Design
- Service Design
- Content Strategy
- Product Design

Some of the teams we are currently hiring for (not a complete list):
Please note, while a candidate's preference on teams may be taken into consideration, a final hiring decision on which team a candidate will join depends on the candidate's skillsets as well as current needs of each team. 
- [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/): Cross-discipline teams that work on projects supporting agencies across the federal government.
- [USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/): A team supporting a large web presence, including the government’s “front door” that routes the public to government agency resources.
- [Centers of Excellence](https://coe.gsa.gov/): Cross-discipline teams work with agency partners and industry to accelerate enterprise-wide IT & data modernization with emphasis on improving the customer and employee experience.
- [Login.gov](https://login.gov/): Teams supporting a product that manages identity for interactions with the federal government.

## Key objectives
### 1. Demonstrate excellence in design, while grasping the core questions and responsibilities of at least one design discipline.

In addition to strong skill in experience design, we expect expertise in at least one of the following disciplines:
- Support collaborative decision-making by telling compelling stories drawn from research to build shared understanding
- Show persistent commitment to thoughtful, inclusive, ethical user research
- Deliver whatever’s needed to guide development — this could include wireframes, sitemaps, flowcharts, storyboards, user stories, or other innovative approaches
- Create written materials and visual presentations that are accessible to non-experts as well as being legally and technically accurate

### 2. Advance design practices
- Clearly communicate user-centered methods and their value to non-designers
- Mentor and coach colleagues and partners who are taking on new tasks and roles within design and research
- Share knowledge, techniques, tools, patterns, and expert advice with colleagues, partners, and the public
- Promote empathy not just for members of the public, but also for our partners across the government and our co-workers
- Contribute to team-wide resources and training materials, including methods, tutorials, guides, presentations, and design toolkits

### 3. Work effectively in the federal government
- Build inclusive, respectful partnerships with diverse groups of people
- Participate in design activities and work effectively with cross-disciplinary teammates
- Demonstrate genuine interest in the day-to-day activities that keep our government running
